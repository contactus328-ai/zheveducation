    <h2>Comprehensive Application Support</h2>
    <p>
      Zhev Education offers end-to-end services for students planning to study abroad. Our application
      support covers university shortlisting (targeting top ranked CS, engineering and management programs),
      personalised admission strategies, application form filling, deadline tracking and document uploads.
      We help students prepare for competitive programs like MS in Computer Science, MS in Data Science,
      MBA, and other masters and bachelor programs abroad.
    </p>

    <h3>SOP, LOR & Resume Services</h3>
    <p>
      Our SOP (Statement of Purpose) service includes multiple drafts, targeted edits for program intent,
      and industry-aligned language that highlights projects, internships and research. We coordinate LOR
      collection guidelines with recommenders and help craft resumes that match international admissions
      expectations (technical resumes for CS applicants, project portfolios for design & architecture).
    </p>

    <h3>Scholarships & Education Loans</h3>
    <p>
      We research university scholarships, country-level scholarships and external grants relevant to each
      student profile. We also guide students through education loan documentation and lender selection,
      including loan options with or without collateral where available.
    </p>

    <h3>Visa Assistance & Interview Prep</h3>
    <p>
      Visa filing support includes document checks, mock interviews, and guidance on country-specific
      visa policies (F1 for USA, Study Visa for UK, Student Direct Stream for Canada). We prepare students
      for likely interview questions and compile evidence packages for visa officers.
    </p>

    <h3>Pre-Departure & Post-Arrival Support</h3>
    <p>
      Pre-departure briefings include accommodation guidance, health insurance advice, packing checklists,
      and orientation on banking & local transport. Post-arrival help covers bank account setup, local SIM,
      and initial orientations with partner universities where possible.
