    <h2>Our Core Services</h2>
    <h3>1. University Shortlisting</h3>
    <p>
      We evaluate your profile, preferences, and career aspirations to suggest universities that match 
      your goals. For technical courses such as Computer Science, Data Science, AI/ML, Cybersecurity and 
      Engineering, we recommend programs with strong labs, research output, internship opportunities and 
      industry tie-ups. For MBA and Management programs, we focus on ROI, placements and global rankings.
    </p>

    <h3>2. SOP & LOR Drafting</h3>
    <p>
      Our expert writers prepare SOPs that highlight your strengths, academic achievements, technical 
      projects, internships and motivations. We craft LORs that align with university expectations and 
      enhance the credibility of your application. Every document undergoes multiple revisions to ensure 
      quality, clarity and uniqueness.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Application Filing & Document Support</h3>
    <p>
      We take care of application form filling, essay reviews, resume structuring, document uploads, 
      transcript formatting, deadline tracking and portal submissions. Students receive full guidance on 
      courier documents, WES evaluations and financial documentation.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Scholarship & Loan Assistance</h3>
    <p>
      We help students find university-funded scholarships, government scholarships, partial tuition 
      waivers, assistantships and external funding options. For education loans, we support students in 
      understanding eligibility criteria and connecting with lenders offering collateral and non-collateral 
      loans.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Visa Filing & Interview Preparation</h3>
    <p>
      Our visa support includes compiling forms, checking financial proofs, preparing travel history 
      documentation and conducting detailed mock interviews. We coach students for USA F1 visa interviews, 
      UK Student Visa SOPs, Canada SDS documentation and Australia GTE requirements.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Pre-Departure & Post-Arrival Support</h3>
    <p>
      We guide students on accommodation, health insurance, forex, SIM cards, travel plans, packing lists 
      and local transportation. Post-arrival support includes orientation on survival skills, tax ID 
      applications, bank accounts and university onboarding.
