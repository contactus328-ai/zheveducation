    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      Zhev Education is a leading study abroad consultancy helping students across India secure admissions to 
      top-ranked universities worldwide. With deep expertise in international education systems, our counsellors 
      guide students through every step of their journey – from university shortlisting to application submission, 
      SOP & LOR drafting, interview preparation, visa filing and pre-departure support.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years, we have helped hundreds of students successfully pursue programs in fields such as Computer Science, 
      Data Science, Engineering, Business, Healthcare, Architecture, Design and more. Whether it is MS in Computer Science 
      in the USA, MBA in the UK, Data Science programs in Canada, or high-value courses in Ireland and Australia, 
      we provide customised guidance based on academic background, finances, and long-term goals.

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Our mission is to simplify studying abroad for Indian students. The global admissions process can feel confusing – 
      varying deadlines, SOP requirements, eligibility criteria, scholarship options and visa procedures. 
      Our goal is to make this journey structured, stress-free and successful by providing clear, end-to-end guidance.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe in ethical counselling, transparency and accuracy. Every university recommendation and document review 
      is personalised to ensure the highest acceptance chances. Students receive complete support irrespective of their 
      destination – USA, UK, Canada, Ireland, Australia or New Zealand.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Help Students Succeed</h2>
    <p>
      Our counselors conduct detailed profile evaluations, identify strengths, suggest improvements, and create 
      customised application plans. For competitive programs like MS in CS, Data Science, AI/ML, Cybersecurity, 
      Engineering and MBA, we focus on crafting strong SOPs, achievements and technical resumes that highlight 
      projects, internships, academic research and professional experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visa officers evaluate intent, financial stability and clarity of academic plan. Our mock interviews and 
      documentation checks help students confidently clear F1 (USA), SDS (Canada), Tier-4 (UK), and other visa processes.
