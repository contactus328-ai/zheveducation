    <h2>Our Mission & Experience</h2>
    <p>
      Zhev Education was founded to simplify the complex process of studying abroad for Indian students.
      Our mission is to provide transparent, practical guidance for admissions to top ranked programs —
      including MS in Computer Science, MBA programs, Data Science masters, and healthcare degrees.
      Our consultants have industry experience in university admissions, test preparation strategies and visa
      procedures. We curate personalised university shortlists for the USA, UK, Canada, Ireland, Australia and
      New Zealand with a focus on outcomes — scholarship chances, employability, and post-study work pathways.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <p>
      We use a step-by-step process: eligibility assessment, program matching, application calendar,
      document preparation (SOP/LOR/resume), scholarship research, and visa interview coaching.
      For program specific help like MS in CS or Data Science, we provide targeted SOP revisions and
      technical resume alignment that highlights projects, internships and publications.
    </p>

    <h2>Team & Credentials</h2>
    <p>
      Our team includes former admission officers, test prep specialists and visa consultants. We maintain
      direct relationships with partner universities for timely updates on cutoffs, scholarships and intake
      options. We also support education loan assistance and pre-departure briefings so students travel
      prepared and confident.
